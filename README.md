# 🖼️ Img2Ascii - Java Image to ASCII Art Converter

**Img2Ascii** is a simple Java program that converts an image into ASCII characters and prints the result in the terminal. It works by converting the image to grayscale and mapping brightness levels to ASCII symbols.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
img2ascii/
└── src/
    ├── img.png           # Example image (you can add more: img_1, img_2, etc.)
    ├── Img2ascii.java    # Core logic for reading image and converting to ASCII
    └── Main.java         # Entry point of the program
```

---

## 🧰 Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or above
- Any Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, VSCode) or command-line terminal

---

## 🔧 Setup & Run

### 🖥️ Using an IDE:
1. Open the project in your Java IDE.
2. Update the image path in `Main.java`:
   ```java
   demo.imageReader("C:/img2ascii/src/img.png");
   ```
   Or for Linux:
   ```java
   demo.imageReader("/home/abdullah/IdeaProjects/img2ascii/src/img.png");
   ```
3. Run `Main.java`.

### 🧑‍💻 Using Terminal:
Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
javac src/*.java
java -cp src Main
```

> ✅ Ensure your image file exists and the path is correct!

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Loads the image using Java's `ImageIO`
- For every 3rd row (to match character height), reads the pixels
- Converts each pixel's RGB to grayscale
- Maps grayscale brightness to an ASCII character using a brightness scale
- Prints it to the terminal

---

## 🎨 Brightness Mapping

From darkest to lightest:

```
@ # s % ? * + ; .
```

---

## ✏️ Sample Output

```
@@@###%%??**++;;..
@@@###%%??**++;;..
...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
```

> The actual output varies based on the image resolution and contrast.

---

## 🧠 Future Improvements

- Accept image file path as a command-line argument
- Resize image automatically
- Export ASCII output to a text file
- Add ANSI color output for terminals

## 💡 Tips

- Simple, high-contrast images give better ASCII results.
- You can tweak the ASCII character range in `printGray()` for different artistic styles.
